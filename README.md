Encryptix

Welcome to the Encryptix repository! This repository contains various machine learning projects related to predictive analytics and classification. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project within this repository.
Contents
1. Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for businesses. Using historical customer data, machine learning models are built to identify customers who are likely to leave the service or product.

Objective: Predict customer churn to help businesses retain valuable customers.
Techniques Used: Classification algorithms, feature engineering, model evaluation.

2. Movie Genre Prediction

This project involves predicting the genre of movies based on various features such as plot summary, cast, and other metadata. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify movies into their respective genres.

Objective: Classify movies into genres using machine learning models.
Techniques Used: Text analysis, feature extraction, classification algorithms.

3. Spam SMS Detection

This project aims to identify and filter out spam messages from a dataset of SMS texts. The goal is to create a robust model that can differentiate between spam and legitimate messages.

Objective: Detect and classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.
Techniques Used: Text classification, natural language processing, feature extraction.
